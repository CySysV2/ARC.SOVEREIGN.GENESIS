# Quantum Internet Computer (QIC)

**Subdomain:** qic.digital-fabrica.com  
**Role:** Core computational node of DFT ecosystem housing FNS subnets, quantum logic infrastructure, and epoch-bound modular topologies.

---

## Purpose & Scope

`qic.digital-fabrica.com` is the living computational substrate for:

- Hosting the **Fabrica Nervous System (FNS)** root + recursive subnets.
- Executing **quantum-coherent governance**, routing, and resource allocation logic.
- Acting as the **main execution layer** for infinite-scale digital fabrics.
- Providing cryptographic primitives, modular congruence proofspaces, and zk interface pipelines.
- Integrating distributed sublogic from connected fabrics: IKL, CivicDash, TangraChain, etc.

## Deployment Path

- Build site with `vitepress build`
- Deploy to IPFS: `ipfs add -r .vitepress/dist > manifest.cid`
- Sync CID in `registry.json`
- Update TXT record: `_dnslink.qic.digital-fabrica.com`
- Register with ICP if needed under DFT-Core anchor canister
