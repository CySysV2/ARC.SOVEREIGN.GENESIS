# Quantum Harmonic Operations (Operator 11411)

## Summary
Comprehensive daily, emergency, and optimization procedures for quantum harmonic orchestration, including checklists, scripts, and critical paths for Operator 11411.

## Table of Contents
- Daily Operations
- Emergency & Recovery
- Optimization & Health
- Critical Paths & Contacts
- TODOs & Open Questions

## Daily Operations
### Morning Startup Sequence
- Initialize Quantum Core (`Start-StableQuantumSync.ps1`)
- Verify metrics from latest logs
- Run Master Cascade (`QuantumHarmonic_MasterCascade.ps1`)

### Stability Checks
- Monitor Alpha, Beta, Gamma bands (target/critical thresholds)
- System metrics: Coherence, Resonance, Phase

### Backup Verification
- Check backup logs in `C-STATION`

## Emergency & Recovery
- Stop all cascades/processes, reset quantum core, verify recovery
- System recovery: stop all, clear Q: drive, reinitialize, verify, resume

## Optimization & Health
- Frequency: 440 Hz (fixed), Echo Depth: 7-9, Phase: Active
- Band Weights: Alpha (locked), Beta/Gamma (adjustable, phase 0.03 rad)
- Health Checklist: morning, midday, evening routines for initialization, verification, backup, and anomaly documentation

## Critical Paths & Contacts
- Logs: Quantum metrics, system analysis, backup logs
- Scripts: Quantum core, master cascade, emergency recovery
- Contacts: SBSÎ© Team, C-STATION, Quantum Core Support

## TODOs & Open Questions
- [ ] Automate extraction of metrics and anomalies from logs
- [ ] Nightly/triggered updates to indices and cross-links
- [ ] Maintain audit trail for all operator actions
