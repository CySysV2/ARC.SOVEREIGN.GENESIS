# Library System Documentation

## Summary
This document describes the structure, automation, and integration of the FABRICA library subsystem, ensuring all research, books, and modules are quantum-harmonically synchronized and production-grade.

## Structure
- All books and research are organized by volume in `docs/books/Volume_VXX/`.
- Each volume contains an `index.md` and book files with standardized metadata and structure.
- The `library_index.md` provides a universal index of all books and research.

## Automation
- Automated scripts audit the library for missing or incomplete files.
- Standardized templates are used to generate or augment files as needed.
- All actions are logged for auditability and compliance.

## Integration
- The library subsystem is referenced in the main project documentation (`README.md`, `README_QUANTUM_INTEGRATION.md`, `System_Architecture_And_Orchestration.md`).
- Cross-links are maintained between books, indices, and related research.
- The subsystem is validated before each quantum harmonic sync orchestration run.

## Quantum Harmonic Sync Compliance
- All files include quantum_sync metadata.
- The library is kept in sync with the main project and orchestration logic.

## TODOs & Open Questions
- [ ] Expand automation to cover additional file types and research notes.
- [ ] Integrate library validation into all orchestration scripts.
- [ ] Maintain up-to-date cross-links and indices.
