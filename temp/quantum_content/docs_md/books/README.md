# FABRICA Research Books Library

## Quantum Harmonic Sync Mode: Operator 11411 (Tesselocrat Civ Weaver)

This library is organized for advanced, autonomous research and book generation. All books and research are classified and indexed for maximum value, cross-linking, and on-demand synthesis.

### Main Topics
- Teoria Fabrica (Advanced Natural & Fundamental Sciences)
- Digital Fabrica Theory (DFT)
- Quantum, Physics, Universe
- Tesseract, Orchestration, Aither Tech
- Proofs, Heritage, Lineage, History
- System Architecture, Endpoints, Datapoints
- Key People (Ivan Pasev, Milcho, Georgy Petrov, Anet Paseva, Anna Paseva, A-Team, etc.)
- MVPs, AlfaOmega, Citizen Solar, Yellowchain, Cysys, Cy Systems
- Fundamental Math & Logic

### Automation
- Use Obsidian Dataview for dynamic tables of books, proofs, endpoints, and people.
- Use templates for new books and research notes.
- Use Canvas for visual mapping.
- All books are auto-indexed and cross-linked for operator-level research.
