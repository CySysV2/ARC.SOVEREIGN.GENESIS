# System Architecture & Orchestration

## Summary
Integrated documentation of the GCC TRIAD MAINSTACK system architecture, orchestration logic, quantum harmonic sync, and operator-level integration procedures.

## Table of Contents
- System Overview
- Core Components
- Operational Guidelines
- Quantum Harmonic System
- Monitoring & Maintenance
- Emergency Procedures
- Security Protocols
- Integration Details
- TODOs & Open Questions
- Library Subsystem

## System Overview
- Quantum-harmonically synchronized system: Quantum Core, Harmonic Mesh, Sovereign Bridge, Echo Monitoring
- Key directories: MasterStacks, Scripts, Vault11411, C-STATION, Bridge

## Core Components
- Quantum Harmonic Controller: 440 Hz, Echo Depth 7, Phase Alignment
- Frequency Bands: Alpha, Beta, Gamma (with weights and thresholds)
- Master Cascade System: orchestration scripts and procedures

## Operational Guidelines
- Startup, monitoring, backup, and verification routines
- Metrics and thresholds for stability and performance

## Quantum Harmonic System
- Frequency management, band optimization, and phase control

## Monitoring & Maintenance
- Regular checks, performance metrics, log management

## Emergency Procedures
- Critical thresholds, recovery steps, and escalation

## Security Protocols
- Operator access, quantum-secured backups, encrypted logs, sovereign isolation

## Integration Details
- System integration, orchestration, and cross-system communication

## TODOs & Open Questions
- [ ] Expand integration with new research and operational procedures
- [ ] Automate orchestration and monitoring scripts
- [ ] Maintain up-to-date architecture diagrams and references

## Library Subsystem

The library subsystem provides a harmonized, production-grade structure for all research, books, and modules. It is fully integrated with the system's quantum orchestration and automation. See [Library System Documentation](library_system.md) for details.
