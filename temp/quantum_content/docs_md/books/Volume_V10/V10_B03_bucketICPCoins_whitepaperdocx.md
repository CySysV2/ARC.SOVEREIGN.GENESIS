## Introduction
ICPCoins leverage the latest advances in quantum cryptography and distributed systems to provide a secure, efficient, and resilient digital currency. The system is designed to withstand both classical and quantum attacks, ensuring long-term viability and trust.

## Quantum Cryptography in Digital Currency
The ICPCoins protocol incorporates quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions and wallet management. This approach mitigates risks from emerging quantum computing threats.

## Distributed Ledger and Consensus
ICPCoins utilize a distributed ledger architecture, with consensus mechanisms optimized for quantum-classical hybrid environments. The system ensures transaction integrity, transparency, and scalability across a global network of operators.

## Operator Governance and Security
Operator-driven governance models are implemented to manage protocol upgrades, resolve disputes, and maintain system integrity. Security protocols are continuously updated based on operator feedback and quantum research developments.
