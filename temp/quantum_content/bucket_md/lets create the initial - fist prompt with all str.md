# lets create the initial - fist prompt with all structural and logical details neeed to develop digital-fabrica.com website expanding from Create a docs site with Vitepress ...using bolt.net and lovable.dev. don't use prompt tokens for colors specific settings ,both builders will figure out details, need the best possible structured prompt so i can finish a mockup using them, and further develop it in Cursor ide locally

### Initial Prompt for Digital Fabrica Website Development

**Objective**: Create a comprehensive documentation site for Digital Fabrica using Vitepress, integrated with Bolt.net for backend functionality and Lovable.dev for UI/UX design.

#### 1. **Project Structure**

- **Root Directory**:
    - `src/`: Contains all source code for the website.
    - `docs/`: Vitepress documentation files and whitepaper content.
    - `lovable.dev/`: Sub-project for UI/UX design elements.
    - `dfx.json`: Configuration file for deploying on Internet Computer (ICP).
    - `.cursorrules`: Rules and guidelines for Cursor Agentic Composer.


#### 2. **Vitepress Documentation Setup**

- **Main Sections**:
    - **Home Page**:
        - Introduction to Digital Fabrica and DFT.
        - Call-to-action buttons for supporting research and accessing the whitepaper.
    - **Theory**:
        - Detailed explanations of the Digital Fabrica Theory.
        - Mathematical foundations, including Ramanujan's infinities and Mathias' hierarchy.
    - **Governance**:
        - Overview of governance models based on DFT principles.
        - Interactive diagrams illustrating governance structures.
    - **Security**:
        - Explanation of quantum security measures implemented in DFT.
        - Use cases and examples of secure applications.
    - **Economics**:
        - Insight into tokenomics and zeta-regulated governance models.
        - Visualizations of economic models and supply dynamics.


#### 3. **Content Flow**

- Each section should include:
    - A brief introduction summarizing the section's focus.
    - In-depth articles or pages linked within the section.
    - Interactive elements or visualizations where applicable (e.g., graphs, charts).
- Ensure that all content is interconnected with clear navigation paths.


#### 4. **Integration with Bolt.net**

- Set up backend services to handle:
    - User authentication (if applicable).
    - Data storage and retrieval for interactive elements (e.g., donation tracking).
- Ensure API endpoints are well-documented within the Vitepress site.


#### 5. **UI/UX Design with Lovable.dev**

- Utilize Lovable.dev to create:
    - A modern, responsive layout that aligns with the Digital Fabrica branding.
    - Consistent typography and spacing throughout the site.
    - Intuitive navigation menus that enhance user experience.


#### 6. **Cursor IDE Development**

- Use Cursor IDE to:
    - Implement real-time collaboration features for documentation editing.
    - Develop reasoning capabilities that assist in generating content based on user queries.
- Set up a local development environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.


#### 7. **Mockup Requirements**

- Create wireframes for each main section of the site using Lovable.dev:
    - Home Page: Highlight key features of DFT and provide easy access to primary resources.
    - Theory Section: Layout should allow for easy reading of complex mathematical concepts with visual aids.
    - Governance Section: Incorporate interactive diagrams that users can manipulate to understand structures better.


#### 8. **Deployment Considerations**

- Prepare deployment scripts to ensure smooth transitions from local development to production on ICP.
- Include instructions in the README for setting up the local environment, building the project, and deploying it.
