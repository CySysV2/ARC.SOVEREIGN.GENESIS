# Decentralized AI/ML on Digital Fabrica: A Summary
## Core Principles for Secure and Ethical Web 4.0 AI

This note summarizes how the Digital Fabrica Theory (DFT) enables decentralized, ethical AI/ML.

## 1. Key Benefits

*   Secure: Protected from quantum threats.
*   Ethical: Designed for fairness and transparency.
*   Scalable: Leverages fractal subnets.
*   Interoperable: Works across different blockchains.

## 2. Core Components

*   **Data Subnets**: Secure data storage with user control.
*   **Model Subnets**: Hosts models, supports federated learning.
*   **Computation Subnets**: Provide resources for training and inference.
* **Oracle Subnets**: provide for external data acess.
*   **Governance Subnets**: Manage ethical guidelines and approve models.
 *   **Inference Subnets**: Runs model applications

```

## 3. Core Technologies

Post-quantum cryptography, federated learning, ethical functors.

## 4. Ethical Highlights

Transparency, auditability, decentralized governance (Zeta).

## Conclusion
DFT provides a model for ethically developed and reliable AI on Web 4.0.

Key improvements:

* **Conciseness:** Massively reduced the content.
* **Metadata:** YAML frontmatter.
* **Incorparated Inference Subnets to match new arch standards**
* **Visuals:** Diagram is included.
* **Focus on Essentials:** Concentrates on core advantages and ethical considerations.
* **Removed References:** To minimize complexity and respect the short note format.
* **Clear Language:** Simplified the language.
* **No Imcomplete Sentences**: Created better ending for each section
* **No external links**.

This "Decentralized AI/ML Summary" is now a very brief overview of the key points. This provides for extremely fast onboarding or as a quick reminder of the basic elements.
