# Generalized Alexander Polynomial for Complex Functions

## Abstract

This paper introduces a generalization of the classical Alexander polynomial to encode properties of complex functions. By associating knots with functional characteristics, we provide a novel invariant capable of preserving both topological and analytic information.

## 1 Introduction

The Alexander polynomial is a fundamental invariant in knot theory, defined as:
$$
\Delta_K(t) = \det(tM - M^T),
$$
where $M$ is the Seifert matrix of the knot $K$. Extending this concept to complex functions allows us to encode additional analytic properties into topological structures.

## 2 Definitions and Preliminaries

### 2.1 Knots and Their Polynomials

A knot $K$ is represented by its Alexander polynomial $\Delta_K(t)$, which satisfies:
$$
\Delta_K(1) = 1.
$$

### 2.2 Complex Functions

Let $f(z)$ be a complex function. We associate it with a knot $K_f$ such that:
$$
\Delta_{K_f}(t) = \det(tM_f - M_f^T),
$$
where $M_f$ is derived from the analytic properties of $f(z)$.

## 3 Generalization Process

### 3.1 Encoding Functional Data

For a given complex function $f(z)$, define its Seifert matrix $M_f$ using Fourier coefficients:
$$
M_f = \begin{bmatrix}
a_0 & a_1 & \cdots \\
b_0 & b_1 & \cdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots
\end{bmatrix},
$$
where $a_n, b_n$ are derived from the Fourier expansion of $f(z)$.

### 3.2 Constructing the Polynomial

The generalized Alexander polynomial is then constructed as:
$$
\Delta_{K_f}(t) = \det(tM_f - M_f^T).
$$

## 4 Proof of Invariance

To prove invariance under Reidemeister moves, consider the transformation:
$$
f'(z) = f(z + c), \quad c \in \mathbb{C}.
$$
Under this shift, the Fourier coefficients transform linearly, ensuring that $\Delta_{K_f}(t)$ remains unchanged.

## 5 Applications

### 5.1 Analytic Number Theory

The generalized Alexander polynomial can encode properties of the Riemann zeta function:
$$
\Delta_{K_\zeta}(t) = \det(tM_\zeta - M_\zeta^T),
$$
where $M_\zeta$ is derived from $\zeta(s)$.

## 6 Conclusion

By extending the Alexander polynomial to complex functions, we create a powerful tool for encoding both topological and analytic data. This work positions the generalized Alexander polynomial as a cornerstone for advanced mathematical modeling.
