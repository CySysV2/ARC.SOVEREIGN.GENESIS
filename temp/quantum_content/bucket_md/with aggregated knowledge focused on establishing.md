**Example Application**: Securing dark matter allocation treaties (e.g., helium-3 mining rights on Mars) using tamper-proof consensus .

---

#### **5. Dynamic Resource Allocation**

**Core Innovation**: Ethical resource partitioning using Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic fairness.

- **Patent Focus**:
    - **Cosmic Compute Credits (CCC)**: Tokenomics system where resource access (e.g., telescope time) is allocated via $p(n)$-weighted governance, favoring projects with high dark matter validation impact .
    - **Ricci Flow Optimization**: AI-driven policy adjustments on 3D data manifolds (e.g., $X(7)$ modular curve) to minimize ethical "curvature" in resource distribution .

**Example Application**: Allocating ALMA telescope time for [CII] line studies of high-z quasars while maintaining IPC consensus .
