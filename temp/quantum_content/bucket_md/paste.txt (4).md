# The Economic Model of the Digital Fabrica: Zeta-Regularized Economics for Infinite Value

## A Stable, Fair, and Adaptable Framework for Sustainable Decentralized Networks

The Economic Model of the Digital Fabrica, termed "Zeta-Regularized Economics," is designed to be stable, fair, sustainable, and adaptable. It supports the requirements of an infinitely scalable, ethically governed, and quantum-secure decentralized network.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Infinite Value Creation:** Support the creation and exchange of infinite value.
- **Mathematical Stability:** Grounded in rigorous mathematical foundations.
- **Fairness and Equity:** Distribute resources and voting power fairly.
- **Ethical Alignment:** Integrate ethical considerations.
- **Adaptability:** Parameters adjustable through governance.
- **Incentivization:** Properly incentivize network actors.


## 2. Tokenomics: The FAB Token

The Digital Fabrica uses a native token, FAB, to facilitate economic activity.

### 2.1. Token Utility

- Governance: Participate in network governance.
- Staking: Secure the network and earn rewards.
- Transaction Fees: Pay for transactions.
- Resource Access: Access computational resources.
- Incentivization: Reward contributions.
- Cross-Chain Operations: Facilitate cross-chain transactions.


### 2.2. Token Supply Model: Riemann Zeta Function

The total supply of FAB is regulated by the Riemann zeta function:

$$
ζ(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s} = \prod_{p \in Primes} (1 - p^{-s})^{-1}, \quad Re(s) > 1
$$

This provides a rigorous and predictable basis for the token supply, controlled via governance.

### 2.3. Zeta-Regularized Quadratic Voting

DFT's governance uses zeta-regularized quadratic voting:

$$
w_i = \frac{ζ(s)}{\sum_j ζ(s)} \cdot \sqrt{T_i}
$$

where:

- $$
w_i
$$: Voting weight of user i.
- $$
ζ(s)
$$: Riemann zeta function.
- $$
T_i
$$: Stake or contribution of user i.


### 2.4. Hardy-Ramanujan Allocation

Resource allocation uses the Hardy-Ramanujan formula:

$$
p(n) \sim \frac{1}{4n\sqrt{3}} \cdot e^{\pi\sqrt{2n/3}}
$$

Allocation =
(e ^ {2sqrt{Demand_k}}) / (4 * Demand_k * sqrt{3})

This ensures combinatorial fairness and efficiency.

### 2.5. Ethical Valuation: Discounted Impact Sums

Ethical Valuation formula
V_RWA = - 1/12 sum from t=0 to inf (gamma ^ t)

Ethical valuation incorporates ethical values.

## Conclusion

The Zeta-Regularized Economic model aims to create a system that is stable, fair, sustainable, and adaptable. It incentivizes long-term contributions, discourages manipulation, and promotes equitable distribution. The framework provides a unified approach for building decentralized systems.
