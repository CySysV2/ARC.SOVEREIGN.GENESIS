# Infinite Core Scaling: A Logarithmic Growth MVM
## Happy Families and Minimal Scaling Model

This note presents a minimum viable model (MVM) for achieving logarithmic scaling ($O(\log n)$) in the Digital Fabrica Theory (DFT). By integrating Adrian Mathias' concept of *happy families*, ensures termination, logical consistency.

## 1. Core scaling
*Fractal Geometry

## 2. MVM Structure

*Root canister
*Happy families

## 3. Key formula:
 Recursive formula: $S_{n+1} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{1.5} S_n(i) $.

```

B -->|Invalid Ordinal| D[Error]
C --> E[Topology Manager]

```

*Key Actions*

## Conclusion
Mathias' happy families enables scalability model.
