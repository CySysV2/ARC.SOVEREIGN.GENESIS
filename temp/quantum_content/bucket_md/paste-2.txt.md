# Post-Quantum Cryptography in the Digital Fabrica Theory
## Securing Web 4.0 against the Quantum Threat

This note summarizes how the Digital Fabrica Theory (DFT) incorporates post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to ensure security against quantum computing attacks.

## 1. Core PQC Principles

DFT employs multiple PQC methods:

-   **Lattice-Based:** Relies on hard lattice problems.
-   **Code-Based:** Uses error-correcting codes.
-   **Hash-Based:** Employs secure hash functions.
    -   **Multivariate Cryptography:** Solving polynomial equations.

```

```

## 2. Ramanujan Graphs Enhance Security

-   Ramanujan graphs creates robust networks.

## 3. Zeta Functions for Stable Tokenomics
Formula :

Key =
-   **Token Supply** = ∏p ∈Primes (1 - p-s)-1, ℜ(s) > 1

## Conclusion
These techniques enables long and quantum - resistance.
