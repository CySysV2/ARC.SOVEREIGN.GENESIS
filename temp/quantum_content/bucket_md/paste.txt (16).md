# Patentable Innovations in Digital Fabrica Architecture
## Securing Web 4.0: Key Issues & Research

This note summarizes patentable innovations within the Digital Fabrica Architecture (DFT).

## 1. 14D Geometric Framework
*   Mapping networks into a 14-dimensional space for cross-dimensional reasoning.

## 2. Fractal Scaling System
*   Ensuring scalability with Hausdorff dimension-based subnet replication.

## 3. Zeta-Regularized Governance
*   Leveraging the Riemann zeta function for voting.

## 4. Quantum-Secure Cryptography
*   Using Ramanujan-LPS graph walks.

## 5. Alexander Polynomial Engine
*   Validating smart contracts using knot invariants.

## 6. Ethical Autonomy Framework
*   Enforcing ethical consistency using logical constructs.

## 7. Cross-Dimensional Reasoning
*   Using Hexagonal mapping and with integration in 14D.

Key changes:

* **Content Condensed:** Significant amount of the note is trimmed down to focus on the most significant, patentable elements.
* **Metadata:** YAML frontmatter is present.
* **Added Visualization of DFT elements**: Added Diagram.
* All External References are omited to create short note form.
* **Clean note**
