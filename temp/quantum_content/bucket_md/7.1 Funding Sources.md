    * **Impact:** Integrates ethical considerations into the design and development process from the outset, preventing potential problems down the line.
    * **Cost:** Moderate; primarily involves training and awareness-building for GILC staff.
    * **Feasibility:** Can be implemented relatively quickly by adopting existing frameworks and adapting them to GILC's specific context.
    * **Why:** Proactive ethical design is more effective and efficient than trying to fix ethical problems after a technology has already been developed. It serves as foundation for more advanced and ethical applications.
3. **Ethical Review Board:**
    * **Impact:** Provides crucial oversight and accountability for ethical decision-making within GILC.
    * **Cost:** Moderate; involves recruiting board members and establishing clear procedures.
    * **Feasibility:** Can be implemented relatively quickly by leveraging existing expertise and developing a charter that defines the board's responsibilities and authority.
    * **Why:** Ensures that all GILC projects and activities are subject to ethical scrutiny, promoting responsible innovation and building public trust.

These three tools offer a strong foundation for ethical impact assessment, balancing high impact with relatively low cost and high feasibility. They are essential for establishing a culture of ethical responsibility within GILC and ensuring that its technologies are used to benefit society.
