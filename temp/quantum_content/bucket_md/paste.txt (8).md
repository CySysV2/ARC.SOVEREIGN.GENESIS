# Mathematical Foundations of Digital Fabrica Theory (DFT)
## Core Concepts for Scalable, Secure, and Ethical Web 4.0 Systems

This note summarizes the mathematical foundations of the Digital Fabrica Theory (DFT).

## 1. Set-Theoretic Foundations: Logical Consistency

- Well-founded hierarchies ensure no infinite loops.

## 2. Fractal Geometry: Infinite Scalability

- Recursive subnet generation
- **Key Formula:** Hausdorff dimension (D\_H ≈ 1.5).

```

A[Root Subnet] --> B(Fractal Scaling)
B --> C[Subnet 1]
B --> D[Subnet 2]
B --> E[More Subnets...]

```

## 3. Number Theory: Cryptographic Security & Economic Stability

- Ramanujan graphs provide optimal connectivity
- The zeta function allows economic parameters and token supply
- Post-quantum cryptography (Latticed base etc).

## 4. Knot Theory: Ethical Governance

- Policies as knots for Tamper resistance representations

```

A(User Submits Proposal) --> B{Knots and Tangles resolver}
B --> C{Validates Knots from Database}

```

## Conclusion

DFT is built on strong mathematical principles, ensuring scalable, secure, and ethically governed systems.
